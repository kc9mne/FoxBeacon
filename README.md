if the 3rd switch is on and the other 2 are off it will just play the files in order on a loop.

The DAC pin is the linelevel out for the radios mic input, on a baofeng or other kenwood compatable radios this is the left channel on the 3.5mm stereo plug
The ground on the other side of the board is both the ground for the mic jack and the power to the board.
